Although the opening weekend of \u2018Oblivion\u2018 didn\u2019t break any records big or small, it\u2019s a more than solid start for a non-franchise, non-sequel, non-reboot. That\u2019s a sad statement on the current state of Hollywood, but that\u2019s another topic for another day.

Still, it\u2019s Cruise\u2019s biggest opening in quite some time and certainly a step up from \u2018Jack Reacher\u2019s\u00a0disappointing domestic run last year. At the end of the day, \u2018Oblivion\u2019 cost a lot of money and this weekend was a really good start. We\u2019ll see how the next few weeks treat it. The weekend was also very kind to \u201842,\u2019 which took a small drop from last week for a weekend gross of $18 million and a $54 million total. With a reported budget of only $40 million, this means that \u201942\u2032 is well on its way to being a significant (if slightly minor) hit. Most blockbusters would kill for this kind of profit. Meanwhile, \u2018The Croods\u2018 held onto the number three spot for the third weekend in a row, grossing $9.5 million for a $154 million total. Although $200 million is still a long ways off, DreamWorks\u2019 animated caveman movie has proven shockingly resilient over the past month. Unless it\u2019s completely derailed by the arrival of \u2018Iron Man 3\u2032 in a few weeks (and everything\u00a0in the top ten will be derailed when that happens), it may still have a shot. If not, $180 million is probably a sure thing at this point and that\u2019s nothing", "language": [], "title": "", "url": "http://965kvki.com/weekend-box-office-report-oblivion/", "hypotheses":
